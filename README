A tetris program that me and my friend Yusheng built for UIUC CS241 Honor section. The whole project is built from scratch.

This game is capable of multiplayer mode. Each player can see the current state of the other player through a tiny window at the top of screen. 

The game has two modes of competition. 
Seesaw mode: For each row that one player clears, the other player will have a new row with five randomly chose blocks added up to the bottom. 
Sabotage mode: For each row that one player clears, the other player will have a randomly chose Tetrimino fall and lock down instantly.
