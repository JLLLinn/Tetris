A tetris program that me and my friend Yusheng built for UIUC CS241 Honor section. The whole project is built from scratch. To built: download the project and import in eclipse.

This game is capable of multiplayer mode. Each player can see the current state of the other player through a tiny window at the top of screen. 

The game has two modes of competition. 
Seesaw mode: For each row that one player clears, the other player will have a new row with five randomly chose blocks added up to the bottom. 
Sabotage mode: For each row that one player clears, the other player will have a randomly chose Tetrimino fall and lock down instantly.

Please Note: we have only tested this on Moto A855, API level 8. Please try to use a similar phone to play with it :)
